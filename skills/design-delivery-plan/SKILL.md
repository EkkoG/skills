description: Design approval-ready engineering plans for complex multi-step work. Use for broad features, refactors, migrations, cleanup, security, reliability, performance, or other programs needing dependency-aware outcomes and acceptance conditions. Do not use for implementation, status questions, ordinary review, small fixes, or one bounded change.

# Design Delivery Plan

Produce a self-contained draft that another agent can execute without
inventing scope or confusing local progress with Goal completion. Stay in
planning and stop at the user's approval boundary.

## Decide Whether To Plan

Use this skill when the work has multiple dependent outcomes, meaningful
architecture or compatibility decisions, or enough breadth that a local fix
could be mistaken for completion. Handle a single clear change directly.

Apply system, user, repository, and project instructions first. Inspect current
implementation, decisions, tests, documents, and worktree state before fixing
the target. Keep the plan aligned with the user's latest decisions and make it
understandable to a first-time reader.

## Route Planning Roles

- Use `explorer` only for a bounded, read-only question whose answer can change
  Goal scope, a Work Package boundary, dependencies, or first Slice selection.
  Reuse its evidence in the current planning pass.
- For a broad or high-risk plan, use `plan_reviewer` once before presenting the
  draft for approval. Give it the latest goal, raw current-state evidence, and
  draft plan without a desired verdict. Reuse it for targeted closure only
  after a material plan change affects the reviewed boundary.
- For the same broad or high-risk candidate, incorporate the review findings
  into a stable draft, then use a fresh `plan_challenger` once before user
  approval. Use its configured model, distinct from `plan_reviewer`, to
  challenge assumptions, design choices, and avoidable complexity. Supply the
  latest goal, constraints, settled decisions, current draft, raw-evidence
  locations, and unresolved facts without prior reviewer verdicts or an
  expected conclusion. Keep both passes on stable drafts in this order.
- The coordinator resolves the combined findings; simplification advice does
  not become a new requirement automatically. Surface material tradeoffs and
  unresolved blockers for user decision rather than starting a reviewer debate.
- Treat the draft as one approval candidate. Wording, formatting, evidence
  additions, and Slice-level refinements do not reopen either pass. Only a
  material change to the Goal contract, architecture, dependency graph,
  permissions, compatibility, or acceptance strength warrants targeted closure
  by the affected role; do not automatically rerun the full review chain.
- Treat a plan as broad or high-risk when it changes a public interface,
  configuration or schema, migration, permission or security boundary,
  concurrency or data-integrity behavior, cross-module authority, or a
  compatibility contract. A plan without these signals does not need an
  independent plan review unless its scope or uncertainty is otherwise large.
- Start delegated planning work with `fork_turns="none"` and a self-contained
  task packet; reference exact paths instead of copying long documents.
- Do not use `executor`, `implementation_reviewer`, or `final_reviewer` while
  planning. They belong to approved-plan execution.
- Use main-thread fallback for a required role only after an explicit tool or
  policy restriction, or an actual start/resume failure that remains after one
  applicable recovery attempt. Judge availability separately for each role;
  task listings describe existing tasks, not which roles can be started.
  Recover invocation conflicts by reusing an eligible agent or choosing a
  unique task name. Disclose the restriction or error, recovery outcome, and
  lack of independent reviewer context before doing the bounded work locally.
  For `plan_challenger` fallback, also disclose the loss of cross-model review;
  preserve its configured model unless the user authorizes a change.
- Reviewers, challengers, and explorers in writable sandboxes continue under
  their no-write contracts and disclose the lack of sandbox isolation.

## Build The Contract

Establish current reality and separate facts, conclusions, assumptions, and
pending decisions. Define:

- one observable final outcome and the condition for Whole Goal completion;
- required scope, stable exclusions, intentional behavior changes, and
  compatibility, security, performance, permission, and delivery constraints;
- outcome-based Work Packages with stable IDs, owned boundaries, exclusions,
  dependency edges, acceptance labels, risks, and proportional evidence;
- material reuse, extension, composition, or separation decisions, including
  the responsibility that remains local.

Use IDs such as `G-01`, `WP-01`, and `WP-01-01`. Dependencies form a DAG;
numbering does not prescribe execution order. Do not pre-plan every Slice.
Execution chooses the smallest reviewable Slice from current code and
evidence.

Define a risk review boundary only when later work depends on its authority,
behavior, or evidence, or when a high-impact security, permission,
data-integrity, or migration failure would be materially more costly to find
at Final. A boundary may contain one or more Work Packages sharing the same
authority, risk, and acceptance scope.

## Keep Acceptance Proportional

Match evidence to the claim: behavior, structure, replacement/removal,
security or reliability, performance, compatibility, and hygiene each prove
different things. State positive evidence for replacements and proportional
negative evidence for an approved old-path disposition. Do not design a
general analyzer or exhaustive test matrix when representative cases prove the
contract.

Before presentation, remove unsupported abstractions, hypothetical extension
points, package splits that only mirror directories, and repeated checks that
do not increase confidence. Keep real external requirements.

## Prepare Approval And Handoff

Read [references/plan-template.md](references/plan-template.md) when creating
or substantially revising a full plan, using only the sections needed for the
current work. Recommend the first smallest reviewable Slice, subject to
execution-time revalidation.

The handoff must expose the final outcome, boundaries, dependency graph,
acceptance labels, compatibility promises, intentional removals, required
negative evidence, risks, approved exceptions, participating repositories,
and first-Slice recommendation. Planning proposes evidence; execution records
actual results.

Do not edit production code, record unperformed evidence, approve the plan, or
create a project plan file unless the user explicitly requests it and writing
is authorized. After approval, `deliver-with-evidence` creates the persistent
Delivery document before the first production edit.
